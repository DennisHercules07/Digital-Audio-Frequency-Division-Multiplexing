    "\n",
    "In telecommunication systems, multiplexing is a technique that allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously, avoiding interference among different channels. One method for multiplexing is Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), which will be analyzed in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into how it works, a couple of definitions are necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseband bandlimited** : the DFT of the signal $x[n]$ with bandwidth $f_{bw}$ is $X(f) = 0, \\ \\forall |{f}|>f_{bw}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Passband** : the energy of the signal $x[n]$ is distributed through the frequencies $f\\in[f_1,f_2]$ where $f_1<f_2,\\ f_1> 0$ and $f_2<f_s/2$. In other words $\\forall f\\notin[f_1,f_2]$ we have $X(f)=0$. Such a passband signal has bandwidth $f_{bw}=(f_2-f_1)/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that in this homework we work with DFT coefficients expressed as frequencies $f$ in Hertz (similar to Homework 3). The discrete-time angular frequency $\\Omega_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}$ is associated with the continuous-time frequency $f$ via the following relationships: $f = \\frac{\\Omega_k}{2\\pi T_s} = \\frac{\\Omega_k}{2\\pi}f_s$ and $\\Omega_k = 2\\pi f T_s = 2\\pi \\frac{f}{f_s}$. Alternatively, you can also use the relationship $f = \\frac{k}{NT_s}$, where $k$ is the index of $\\Omega_k$."

    "\n",
    "The idea of multiplexing is to simultaneously transmit $N$ baseband bandlimited signals, $\\{y_i[n]\\}_{i\\in[N]}$ with bandwidth $f_{bw}$ without interference by exploiting the orthogonality of non-overlapping frequency bands. The following steps are carried out to achieve this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each of the N signals is first *upconverted* to a carrier frequency $f_{c_i}$. *Upconversion* is the operation that shifts a signal to the right in the frequency domain, in this case from a baseband to a passband signal. Mathematically, let $Y_i(f)$ be the DFT of the baseband signal $y_i[n]$ and $Y_i^u(f)$ the DFT of the baseband signal upconverted to the carrier frequency $f_{c_i}$. Then the following relationship holds: $Y_i^u(f) = Y_i(f-f_{c_i})$. We exploit this property for every $\\{y_i[n]\\}_{i\\in[N]}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The resulting upconverted signal $y^u_i[n]$ is  passband and complex. Since we cannot transmit imaginary signals, usually the real part of the upconverted signal is kept, giving $\\hat{y}_i[n] = \\alpha \\operatorname{Re}\\{y^u_i[n]\\}$. The coefficient $\\alpha$ ensures that the energies of $\\hat{y}_i$ and $y_i$ remain the same.\n",

    "Demultiplexing is the inverse operation of multiplexing. Given a multiplexed signal, this operation restores the $N$ original baseband signals. This is done by *downconverting* the multiplexed signal $N$ times with carrier frequencies $\\{f_{c_i}\\}_{i\\in[N]}$. *Downconversion*, like upconversion, also shifts a signal in the frequency domain, except that it shifts to the left instead of to the right. Then, these $N$ downconverted signals are each passed through a lowpass filter with cutoff frequency $f_{p} = f_{mux,bw} =  f_{c_1}$ (called the multiplexing bandwidth) to obtain the $N$ original signals. Keep in mind that the energies of the resulting signals should be the same as the original, so there will be a normalizing coefficient here too. In terms of real world applications: most wireless communication systems use this technique to communicate without interference. As a result one cannot transmit at any randomly chosen carrier frequency as this will possibly interfere with another transmission. Each country has a frequency allocation plan that must be respected. If you look at one of these frequency allocation plans, it is impressive to see how many different communication systems are transmitting at the same time and to consider that this technique allows them not to interfere with one another.\n",
